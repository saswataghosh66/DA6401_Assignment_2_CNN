# **Aim**:Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification on the iNaturalist Dataset
The primary objective of this project is to design and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the [iNaturalist dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/wandb_datasets/nature_12K.zip). This dataset consists of images from various biological categories such as animals, plants, and fungi. The CNN will be trained to recognize and classify these species based on their visual features.
